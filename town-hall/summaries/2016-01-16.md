## Team Member Management

### Accepting new members to the team

- Logged as [new-xkit/organization#1](https://github.com/new-xkit/organization/issues/1)
- Yes, new members may be accepted to the core team
- Member from the community may be nominated by the core team, or community members may approach an existing core team member for nomination
- The core team will discuss whether to accept the nominated community member, and will hold a private voting period (a 5 day interval was suggested for voting) within a reasonable time frame, after which, should a majority of the core team active during the voting interval vote in favour, the community member will be promoted to the core team
- New teams may be created as necessary to better control GitHub permissions for the organization's repositories (a support role, for example, once there are core team members with only support duties)
- Voting and onboarding policy is to be discussed at a later date and added as organization documentation to [new-xkit/organization](https://github.com/new-xkit/organization)

### Managing departing team members

- Team members can leave of their own volition
- Departing team members should notify the rest of the core team that they will no longer be an active core team member
- Core team members' push access will not be revoked solely for inactivity, though the project owners reserve the right to revoke push access should they see fit to do so

## Infrastructure Access & Responsibilities

- Logged as [new-xkit/organization#2](https://github.com/new-xkit/organization/issues/2)
- All infrastructure needs documented deployment steps
- XCloud and the New XKit Organization need recovery plans

### XCloud

- Hosted on an AWS Lambda instance
- ChuckL currently maintains and manages XCloud
- Looking to add more people to reduce the [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor), preferrably hobinjk and one other
  - hobinjk should be added, as they're a New XKit project Owner
  - 0xazure volunteered as a +1 for XCloud, has prior AWS experience

### NewXKitBot

- Hosted on a private Linode instance
- ChuckL maintains the server infrastructure that runs NewXKitBot
- Wolvan has access as well

### Blogs

- Core team members have (or can request request) access to the blogs
- Any support-role members should have access to the -support blog

## New XKit Project Scope

- Some discussion was had about renaming the project, but no consensus was reached and the topic was shelved for a later discussion
  - "XKit" has existing brand recognition, which is important for users
- Consensus was reached that Pipeline should be separated from New XKit

## GitHub Organization Teams

- Push access on `master` should be restricted to the project Owners, and `gh-pages` should be restricted to bots
  - Logged as [new-xkit/organization#3](https://github.com/new-xkit/organization/issues/3)
  - Leave other branches open so core team can collaborate easily on project repo-based branches
  - Noted that push access can be useful when dealing with PRs from new contributors where a core team member will pull the branch, make some final changes, and then merge it into `master` on behalf of the contributor
  - Work-around for fixing up someone else's PR is to close the existing PR and open a new one with the desired changes
- New team to handle support on the blogs/through Gitter/in issues
  - Logged as [new-xkit/organization#4](https://github.com/new-xkit/organization/issues/4)

## State of the Project

### State of the infrastructure

- Close the blog inbox on -extension
  - Logged as [new-xkit/organization#5](https://github.com/new-xkit/organization/issues/5)
- Create a replacement for [xkit.info](http://xkit.info/)
  - Logged as [new-xkit/organization#6](https://github.com/new-xkit/organization/issues/6)
  - Suggested to host the files as a GitHub Page, and apply one of the custom domains the core team has available

### Project success/failures/points of improvement

#### Successes

- Reasonable turn-around times on critical fixes (have Atesh's crazy response time to live up to)
- Good teamwork, more than one person involved with fixes/testing (Editable Reblogs, for example)
- Succeeding with (live) support for assisting users with questions/problems
- High team cohesion for an ad-hoc team
  - get along well
  - lots of passion for the project

#### Failures

- Too reliant on Gitter for decision-making that should be a GitHub issue
- Relevant parties are being left out of the loop on issues/fixes they had a hand in
- Issues are easily buried and not followed up on
- Large backlock of issues that aren't being dealt with/closed out/followed up on
- Lack of clear issue prioritization (things that need immediate attention vs things that can wait)
- New contributor onboarding

#### Ways to improve

- Increase label use
- Create new labels for better sorting / searching
- Self-assign and comment on issues indicating it has been claimed
- Be more objective in addressing support requests / bug reports
- Assign team members to dedicated roles
  - answering asks and handling the support channel
  - reviewing and following up on PRs
- Increase frequency and reduce delay in handing PRs
- Introduce more core team members
- Create milestones to provide clear project direction

### Issue Management

- Decided to drop Waffle
  - Logged as [new-xkit/XKit#959](https://github.com/new-xkit/XKit/issues/959)
- Label use needs to be documented
  - Logged as [new-xkit/XKit#960](https://github.com/new-xkit/XKit/issues/960)

### Code of Conduct

- Logged as [new-xkit/organization#10](https://github.com/new-xkit/organization/issues/10)
- Overall agreement that the project should adopt a code of conduct
- Specific discussion around the code of conduct will be had on the issue

### Standardize Browser Extension Divergence

- Logged as [new-xkit/XKit#719](https://github.com/new-xkit/XKit/issues/719)
- Specific discussion will be had on the issue

# Future XKit Versions

## Defining features for future releases

- SemVer `MAJOR` increment constitutes user-facing changes:
  - a major UI overhaul
  - changes to how extensions are distributed/installed
- Current XKit development will thus target `7.x` releases
- Milestones and milestone discussion will be tracked through a meta-issue on new-xkit/XKit, progress will be tracked by adding issues to a given milestone
- Milestones will be used to track SemVer `MINOR` and up; unnecessary for `PATCH` releases
- Branches will be created at-will for milestones, relevant PRs should target the correct branch
- The existing `8.0.0` Milestone is dead on arrival, and should be removed in favour of a more carefully selected group of issues for the next milestone

## The Great Modularization Project

At its inception, the project started off as maybe a way to resolve the FireFox issues ([new-xkit/XKit#216](https://github.com/new-xkit/XKit/issues/216), etc), but that turned out to be too broad of a scope.  At this point in time the FireFox issues have already been mitigated, at least for the time being. Further consideration also lead to the realization that the goals are pretty orthogonal.  That is, GMP isn't _strictly_ a means to resolve the FireFox problems.  It's something that should happen regardless of what we decide with regards to anything browser-specific.  To that end, the Great Modularization Project is now an attempt to reduce duplication, consolidate and re-organize project structure (predominantly core files), but without introducing new functionality.  Ideally, we'll be leveraging the CommonJS module spec as found in NodeJS and the npm ecosystem (Webpack/Browserify) in the build chain.  This is going to be a long-running project, as the XKit internals also need documenting as they are dealt with, since the current documentation is not in the best place it could be.  Some of the supporting tools have been documented in the JSDoc format to allow for automatic documentation generation, and this should be a goal throughout the XKit codebase.

Further discussion relating to the [Great Modularization Project](https://github.com/new-xkit/XKit/issues/478) is tabled pending proof-of-concepts and a design document.

# Platforms

Firefox:

- See [new-xkit/XKit#216](https://github.com/new-xkit/XKit/issues/216) regarding addon signing

Safari:

- Waiting on a response from Apple, will escalate to support if there is no news

Chrome:

- No news

Mobile:

- Currently supported by only one core team member, dlmarquis
- Bug reports / feature requests are welcome

Other browser support:

- Opera and Pale Moon support may be discussed in the future, if there are enough requests for support

# New Project Initiatives

## Analytics

- Free options don't work well with our current structure, and good options are paid
- User surveys and self-reporting is an option in the interim [new-xkit/XKit#730](https://github.com/new-xkit/XKit/issues/730)
- [Amazon Mobile Analytics](https://aws.amazon.com/mobileanalytics/) was raised as another option to investigate
- Any analytics integration would necessitate communicating with users that the extension now collects data, what data is collected, and provide ways to disable all or parts of the data collection

## The Papercut Project

The Papercut Project is in reference to [Ubuntu's 100 papercuts project](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/One%20Hundred%20Papercuts/Mission), with the goal is to fix all the small, annoying issues.  By doing this, a ton of little things can be taken care of, such as fixing technical debt, updating neglected parts of the project, etc while also potentially bring in new developers who are interested in fixing small bugs.  The idea would be to dedicate a month to be a "Papercut Month" and focus on these small improvements over implementing new features.

- Target a specific month for developer outreach and brand promotion through the initiative
- Introduce new labels to direct potential contributors to issues identified as papercuts
- Document contributing to the project
  - Related: [new-xkit/XKit#487](https://github.com/new-xkit/XKit/issues/487)
  - How to write good PRs
  - XKit's approval/merge process
  - How to find things to fix (related: GitHub labels)
- Announce the initiative through the -extension blog as well as on Gitter
- Possibly start a -dev blog for developer outreach and developer-related news
- Discourage the idea that it's a competition, as it may discourage interested parties from contributing if they don't think they can "win"
  - Give recognition to contributors once the month is over; can provide usernames and number of issues resolved, for example
